# Lumos-Ways
 
Jacket just wanted revenge.  
Beard just wanted a normal life.  
Jake just wanted the truth.  
The Fans just wanted to be like their hero.  
The Son just wanted to make his father proud.  
Richter just wanted to protect his mom.  
Pardo just wanted to be infamous.  
Evan just wanted to write his book.  
  
I just wanted to beat Takeover without wanting to kill myself.
